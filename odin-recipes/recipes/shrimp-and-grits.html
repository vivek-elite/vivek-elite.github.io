    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stone ground grits</li>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Few pieces of bacon</li>
        <li>Andouille sausage</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water, salt, and milk to a standard-sized pot (use half-and-half for an even richer result) and allow the mixture to come to a simmer before whisking in the grits. Gently stir, allowing the grits to come back to a gentle bubbling, then lower the heat and cover until fully cooked. </li>
        <li>While the grits are cooking, finely chop onion, bell peppers, and garlic to prep for the gravy. Next, cook a few pieces of bacon until crisp and remove them from the pan for later use. Add a pound of chopped andouille sausage and cook until the color is a deep brown.</li>        
        <li>Set the sausage aside before quickly sauteing the shrimp in the remaining fat — the goal here is to add color without fully cooking, as the shrimp will finish in the gravy. Set them aside, add a splash of bacon grease to the pan, and saute the garlic vegetable medley until the onions are translucent. </li>
        <li>Whisk in flour, butter, and chicken stock before adding the andouille sausage. Allow the gravy to simmer for 4-5 minutes, then stir in shrimp and fresh parsley. Now's the time for customization — add Cheddar to the grits for an even creamier bite or hot sauce to your gravy for a mouthwatering kick. Spoon the shrimp and gravy over the grits and enjoy the rich flavors of this timeless Southern delicacy.</li>
